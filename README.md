### Installation
In order to run inference or model training, you need to install the necessary dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Inference
To launch inference, it is necessary in the `settings.json` specify the path to the file or video stream, and then run the main script:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
To download our test example video, you can use the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) library and execute the script:
```bash
./scripts/download_sample.bat
```

---

## Training
For training, we used datasets from [Nomeroff](https://nomeroff.net.ua/datasets/).  
There are data from almost all CIS regions, including RU.

To train EasyOCR model:
1. Download the proposed dataset, or use your own, but with the same file structure
2. Use our notebook: `experiments/train_easy_ocr.ipynb`
